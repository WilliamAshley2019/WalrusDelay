This is GPL v3 
This is still very much being tested prealpha  some knobs in various versions still arn't behaving the way I wanted them to.
Be careful with the Feedback, Frequency and reverb knobs. There are two versions I am flaoting of this  one without a dedicated reverb section which was
the original but I toyed with adding a reverb section onto it. This isn't really done satisfactorily at this point but it is the end of the day
and I trying to aim for a plugin a day - and yes not all my attemps have succeed I have a bunch that don't make it onto github due to being unresolved
or completely unusable imho for music making glitched out etc..  this one actually does make sort of need flutter/wow effects.

Juce 8.09
vst3 sdk 

I will update this when the project enters more of an alpha stage and I've met my actual minimum goals for the plugin.. I'm not entirely sure why th efeedback
is so much more than I was aiming for I think I need to delay the buffer more or something need to look at that. Also not 100% sure why  the reverb is building up
I thin it is just playing and repeating at the same level or something seriously need to understand what I am doing with it. Removing the bad revoerb broke
my tape effects so I need to look at it carefully.
